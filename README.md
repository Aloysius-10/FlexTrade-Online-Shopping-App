### **Analysis and Key Insights**

#### 1. **User Engagement & Bounce Rate**

* The analysis revealed a direct relationship between session duration and bounce rate: the longer users stayed on the app, the less likely they were to exit without interaction.
* **Average bounce rate was 49%**, consistently above the industry benchmark of 40%, indicating a need for stronger engagement strategies.

#### 2. **Cart Behavior & Conversion Patterns**

* A positive correlation exists between the number of items added to the cart and successful purchases.

  * For instance, **90% of sessions with 4 items** in the cart resulted in conversion.
  * Conversely, **only 50% of sessions with 54 items** led to successful purchases, suggesting diminishing returns at higher cart volumes.
* Average conversion rate stood at **50%**, well above the global industry average of 2–3%, signalling good conversion potential when users are retained.

#### 3. **User Feedback Analysis**

* A narrow difference was observed in the volume of different feedback types:

  * 106 users requested checkout improvements
  * 94 users reported app crashes
* This indicates that multiple issues are nearly equally important, and all feedback themes should be addressed proactively.

#### 4. **Trend in App Usage**

* Over the years, key metrics such as total users, page views, and cart additions have declined:

  * Peak user engagement was in 2021, with 280 users and 729 cart additions.
  * By 2023, both dropped significantly to **189 users** and **509 cart additions**, suggesting a decline in user retention or app relevance.

#### 5. **Add-to-Cart Rates**

* **Add-to-cart rates** averaged around **50%**, peaking at **52% in 2022** before dropping to **47% in 2023**.
* Despite the drop, these figures remain strong relative to industry expectations (typically between 8–10%).

#### 6. **Page Views**

* A **total of 5,425 page views** were recorded between 2020–2023.
* 2020 saw the highest engagement (**1,550 page views**), which steadily declined to **1,052 views in 2023**, aligning with the drop in other KPIs.

### ✅ **Conclusion**

The UX analysis of FlexTrade’s shopping app uncovered valuable behavioural patterns and performance trends. My key takeaways include:

* User engagement and longer session times are crucial in reducing bounce rates.
* Conversion success is tied to moderate cart activity, highlighting the importance of guiding users toward manageable cart sizes.
* Feedback distribution shows multiple pain points, especially regarding checkout processes and app stability, which must be prioritised equally.
* Consistent decline in core KPIs like user volume, cart activity, and page views signals the need for revitalisation through usability enhancements and strategic marketing.
* The analysis provides actionable insight to boost user retention, optimise the checkout process**, and improve personalisation features, effectively addressing the initial challenges of high bounce rates, cart abandonment, and low average order value.
